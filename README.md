# Chat App Design 

## Requirements

* `node` **>=** `10.13.0`
* `npm`

# Setup

## Installation

1. Choose and download the template from [List of Releases](https://github.com/WeAreAthlon/frontend-webpack-boilerplate/releases).
2. Extract the release archive to a new directory, rename it to your project name and browse the directory.
3. Install all dependencies using `npm` clean install. 

```sh 
$ npm ci
```

> More on the clean install npm command can be read here [`npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html)

> You can still use `npm install` in cases the `npm ci` raises system error due to specific platform incompatibilities.

## Define Package Metadata

* Amend `package.json` file and optionally specify:
    * `name` - Name of your project. A name can be optionally prefixed by a scope, e.g. `@myorg/mypackage`.
    * `version` - Specify and maintain a version number indicator for your project code.
    * `author` - Your organisation or just yourself. You can also specify [`contributors`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors).
    * `description` - Short description of your project.
    * `keywords` - Put keywords in it. Itâ€™s an array of strings.
    * `repository` - Specify the place where your code lives.
    * `license` - Announce your code license, figure out the license from [Choose an Open Source License](https://choosealicense.com) .
    * `engines` - Specify the version of `node` that your stuff works on.
* Configure `webpack.config.js`
  * You can either use the default built-in internal serving capabilities of `browser-sync` package or configure to use an external already running server of your existing web back-end powered application.
    
```js
const serverConfiguration = {
  internal: {
    server: {
      baseDir: 'dist',
    },
    port: 3000,
  },
  external: {
    proxy: 'http://localhost:9000/path/to/project/',
  },
};
```

## Development / Build Assets

### Assets Source

* _SASS_ files are located under `/src/scss/`
* _JavaScript_ files with support of _ES6 / ECMAScript 2016(ES7)_ files are located under `/src/js/`
* _Image_ files are located under `/src/images/`
* _Font_ files are located under `/src/fonts/`
* _HTML_ files are located under `/src/`

### Build Assets

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Enable Source Files Watcher

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

> Define any other files that needs syncing in `files:[]` section under `BrowserSyncPlugin` in `webpack.config.js`

*BrowserSync UI* can be reached by default on this location: http://localhost:3001

### Enable Source Files Watcher Using an Existing Webserver

```sh
$ npm run watch:externalServer
```

Configure the URL to your running external web server in the `webpack.config.json` project under:

```js
const serverConfiguration = {
  // ...,
  external: {
    proxy: 'http://localhost:3000/path/to/project/',
  },
};
```

> Define any other files that needs syncing in `files:[]` section under `BrowserSyncPlugin` in `webpack.config.js`

*Note:* Watching does not work with *NFS* (*Windows*) and machines in *VirtualBox*. Extend the configuration in such cases by:

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  watchOptions: {
    poll: 1000 // Check for changes every second
  }
};
```

### Bundle

Executes both `install` and `watch` tasks in a single command convenient for development:

```sh
$ npm run bundle
```

### Bundle (using external server for preview)

Executes both `install` and `watch:externalServer` tasks in a single command convenient for development with existing webserver back-end powered application:

```sh
$ npm run bundle:externalServer
```

## Production / Build Assets

* Optimize assets for production by:

```sh
$ npm run production
```

## Processed Built Assets

* _CSS_ files are located under `/dist/css/`
* _JavaScript_ files with support of _ES6 / ECMAScript 2016(ES7)_ files are located under `/dist/js/`
* _Images_ are located under `/dist/images/`
  * Images part of the _design_ (_usually referenced in the CSS_) are located under `/dist/images/design/`
  * Images part of the _content_ (_usually referenced via `<img>` tags_) are located under `/dist/images/content/`
* _Fonts_ are located under `/dist/fonts/`
* _HTML_ files are located under `/dist/`

## Run Code Style Linters

* **SASS**

```sh
$ npm run lint-sass
```
* **JS**

```sh
$ npm run lint-js
```
